I planned to use the Korea Seoul City Airport at Seoul Station and meet there at 11 AM, four hours before my flight time. Using the Korea Seoul City Airport allows you to send your luggage in advance, so you don't have to carry heavy bags, and if the airport is crowded, you can quickly enter through the Korea Seoul City Airport check-in area, making it very convenient.

## Preparation for Using Korea Seoul City Airport

When using the Korea Seoul City Airport, you need to use the direct train from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport. It is popular and can sell out, so it's recommended to book in advance on the AREX website. [AREX Website](https://www.airportrailroad.com/)

The ticket costs 11,000 won at the kiosk, but you can buy it in advance on Klook for 8,700 won, so I purchased it beforehand.

Upon arriving at Seoul Station, it wasn't difficult to find the direct train boarding area as there were many signs.

You can purchase your ticket at the kiosk at the boarding area, but the earlier trains were already sold out. When paying, select voucher payment and scan the voucher barcode that you purchased in advance, making the payment 0 won.

Take your ticket, proceed to the right for check-in, and then wait at the airline counter. Jin Air had only one person handling check-in, so there was a bit of a wait.

## Unexpected Issues

While waiting, it was already 11:45 AM. Airlines departing from Incheon Airport Terminal 2 close check-in 3 hours and 20 minutes before departure time. For Terminal 1, it closes 3 hours before departure. Thus, I couldn't check in and had to go to customer service to cancel my direct train ticket.

I had to rush to take a regular train to the airport, check-in, and send my luggage. Those who successfully checked in waited during the luggage inspection and then boarded the direct train after passing the departure screening. At the airport, there is a dedicated entrance for Korea Seoul City Airport users, allowing for a quick process.

## Conclusion

From this experience, I learned that when using the Korea Seoul City Airport, check-in closes 3 hours and 20 minutes before the flight departure time. Next time, I will arrive earlier to use the Korea Seoul City Airport more leisurely. For those planning to use the Korea Seoul City Airport, I recommend booking in advance and allowing plenty of time.
